  <h2>Our Story 🌙</h2>

<p class="story">
28 April 2017 — the day you saw me for the first time.<br>
I was in class 10, you were in 12th.<br>
I didn’t know you then… but you already knew me 🥺❤️
<br><br>

Every day, you waited near your home,<br>
just to see me pass by on my way to tuition.<br>
Months passed… silently, patiently, lovingly 💫
<br><br>

26 November 2017 — my birthday 🎂<br>
That day, I chose you.<br>
That day, we became <b>us</b> 💕
<br><br>

And today… 5 February 2026,<br>
we’re still here.<br>
Still choosing each other.<br>
Still in love. ❤️
</p>
<h3>So tell me…</h3>
<h2>Will you still be my Valentine? 🌹</h2>

From 2017 to forever,<br>
